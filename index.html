                <p>The Cham principality of Panduranga had its center in Ninh Thuận province, but also included much of what is now Bình Thuận province. Panduranga became the political centre of Champa after the fall of Vijaya in 1471. It remained independent until 1832, when emperor Minh Mạng annexed it. Ninh Thuận was merged into Bình Thuận province in 1976, together with Bình Tuy province, Ninh Thuận became a separate province again in 1991</p>
